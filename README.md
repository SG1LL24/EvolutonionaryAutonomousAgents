# EvolutonionaryAutonomousAgents
 Engineering autonomous agent simulation with two agents different in characteristics and abilities. Agents eat food within set duration of time, those eating the most food evolving and those eating the least dying out. Simulation continues until all agents extinct. Deployed with C++ raylib library and research from "The Nature of Code" by Daniel Shiffman
